# Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called users , with columns called username and password .

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.

#### Hint

You can find some useful payloads on our SQL injection cheat sheet .

#### Solution

- Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
- Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns contain text data . Verify that the query is returning two columns, only one of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter: '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'abc'--
- Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the users table: '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--
- Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords.
