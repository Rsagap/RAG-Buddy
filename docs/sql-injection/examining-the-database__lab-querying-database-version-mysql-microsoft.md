# Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string.

#### Hint

You can find some useful payloads on our SQL injection cheat sheet .

#### Solution

- Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
- Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns contain text data . Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter: '+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'#
- Use the following payload to display the database version: '+UNION+SELECT+@@version,+NULL#
