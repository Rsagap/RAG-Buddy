# Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

The database contains a different table called users , with columns called username and password .

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.

#### Solution

- Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
- Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns contain text data . Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter: '+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'--
- Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the users table: '+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--
- Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords.
